# @wealthhealth/modal

A modern, reusable, and animation-ready React modal component built with Tailwind CSS.  
This modal was created for the HRnet refactor (Project 14 – OpenClassrooms) to replace the old `jquery.modal` plugin with a clean and accessible React alternative.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✔ **ESC key closing**
- ✔ **Click outside (backdrop) closing**
- ✔ **Smooth transitions (scale + opacity)**
- ✔ **Blurred backdrop**
- ✔ **Centered dialog**
- ✔ **Tailwind-only styling (no external CSS)**
- ✔ **Custom title & custom content**
- ✔ **Accessible (`role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`)**
- ✔ **Scroll lock when modal is open**

> ⚠ Note: This version does *not* implement focus trap yet, to stay consistent with the current HRnet UI.
